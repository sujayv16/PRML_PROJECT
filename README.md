data set:
------------
The MNIST dataset, an abbreviation for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale, small square of dimensions 28x28 pixels, depicting handwritten single digits ranging from 0 to 9. The primary objective is classification, where the task involves assigning a given handwritten digit image to one of ten classes representing integers from 0 to 9. Notably, the dataset has been extensively explored and is considered "solved," with top-performing models, notably deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs), achieving classification accuracies surpassing 99% on the test set, accompanied by error rates typically ranging between 0.4% and 0.2%. Originally derived from the NIST dataset, MNIST is a subset comprising images from Special Database 1 and Special Database 3, which were compiled from handwritten digits by high school scholars and workers from the United States Census Bureau, respectively. Despite its simplicity, MNIST remains pivotal in machine learning research and education, serving as a benchmark for evaluating novel algorithms and techniques in image classification.
